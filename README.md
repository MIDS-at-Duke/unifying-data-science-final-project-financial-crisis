## Topic 
The influence of financial crisis (Housing crisis 2008 / dot com crisis 2001) across countries with a trade balance mostly influenced by the US or China.

## Motivation
The U.S. and China are the two dominant economies in the world for the most recent 20 years. There have been relevant studies evaluating the impact of financial crisis on those two economies (1). One of the factors that economists study is related to the need of China to maintain surpluses in the balance trade. China requires continuous growth in its exports, in order to secure growing labor stability. Opening a free trade agreement with China exposes smaller economies to unfair trade agreements. So, most regions have tried to negotiate as an economic block to balance commercial power. For example, The European Union has been negotiating open trading with China, in order to improve the negative current commercial balance (2). In this paper, we will compare the impact of the major financial crisis, in 2001 Dot.com and 2008 Housing, in countries/regions/economic blocks that have a significant trade balance with the US and those that have a significant trade balance with China.

## Project Question
1. Will the financial crisis have an impact on Trade Balance? If so, what is the impact for developing and developed countries?
2. Will the financial crisis have an impact on GDP? If so, what is the impact for developing and developed countries?

## Project Hypothesis
There is a different effect between the compared groups (cities, countries, etc) given any of the following status quo they have pre-treatment:
Developed countries
Banking system regulations
Exposure to your economy to China 
Any other difference in how people responded to the crisis
